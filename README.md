AeroRoute Master
Enhancing Flight Navigation Mechanism for Optimal Route Planning and Risk Mitigation
README
Introduction
AeroRoute Master is a comprehensive software solution designed to enhance flight navigation by minimizing human errors and improving automated navigation mechanisms. The system addresses challenges such as unavailable GPS signals, adverse weather conditions (fog, smoke, rain, snow), noise, electronic failures, and varying pressures due to weather conditions and altitude changes.

Objective
The primary objective is to design, develop, and implement a robust software solution that leverages existing algorithms to identify optimal flight paths considering various challenges. The solution provides real-time risk assessment and suggests alternative routes to pilots, airlines, and airport authorities. Additionally, it integrates a real-time health metrics tracker based on flight sensor data.
